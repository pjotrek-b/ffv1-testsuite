ffv1-testsuite
=======================

Contains stuff used for testing the FFV1 video codec.
Initially started for validation during development of FFV1 version 3 (FFV1.3).

I will use this repository to collect information and scripts that can be used
to test FFV1 in various ways, such as:

  * benchmark
  * compression performance
  * error resilience
  * verify losslessness
